### Configuration

These files are used inside the docker image:

1. `~/.ssh/` -- is copied from host to dojo's home `~/.ssh`
1. `~/.ssh/config` -- will be generated on docker container start. SSH client is configured to ignore known ssh hosts.
2. `~/.gitconfig` -- if exists locally, will be copied
3. `~/.profile` -- will be generated on docker container start, in
  order to ensure current directory is `/dojo/work`.
